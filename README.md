# Fourier Animations

![Flower animations](https://github.com/RyanMarcus/fourier_animations/blob/master/output/flower.gif?raw=true)

Animations created via phase-shifting the top-K highest magnitude frequency components.

To run, modify `random_phase.py` with the appropriate filename and number of components. You'll need:

* `scipy`
* `pillow`
* `numpy`

The code was ran using Python 3.5.2.
