Animations created via phase-shifting the top-K highest magnitude frequency components of a still image. Here's the original image used to create the animation above:

To run, modify `random_phase.py` with the appropriate filename and number of components. You'll need:

* `scipy`
* `pillow`
* `numpy`

The code was ran using Python 3.5.2.
